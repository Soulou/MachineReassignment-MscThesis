Resource Allocation Algorithms for Virtualized Service Hosting Platforms
Mark Stillwell , David Schanzenbach , Frédéric Vivien , Henri Casanova

Greedy algorithms : First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, Next Fit, etc.

We also assume a static workload, meaning that each service has constant resource needs ?!

Rigid : Need all the requirements (cannot work without and cannot benefit from more)
Fluid : Can use maximum resources
