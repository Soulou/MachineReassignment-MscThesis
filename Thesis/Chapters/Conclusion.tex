\section*{Conclusion}

An particular effort has been made to make this work reproducible.
All the tools are open-source softwares and protocols standard.
Thanks to \textbf{Ansible} the environment should be easy
to deploy on any infrastructure, physical, virtual or hybrid. 
Even if the obtained results in another deployment of the platform
would be slightly different, it should follow the same trends as
those obtained in this thesis.
