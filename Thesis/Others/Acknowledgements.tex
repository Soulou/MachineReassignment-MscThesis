First and foremost, I must sincerely thank my supervisor Dr Mark Stillwell for
his advices, useful feedbacks and abovall his sympathy. Motivation and
concentration wasn't always easy to find, as I'm working professionaly in
parallele of my study to create a company, but Mark was understading and help
me to revise my goals for this thesis and to find the energy I needed.

Thank you to Pauline, our course administrator for her good work all over this
year, she has been helpful and friendly and I personnaly think that it is
something very important to tie the students of a course together and create
a good atmosphere.

I am also grateful to Cranfield University for offering me the opportunity to
study here by offering to me a scolarship. I'd like to thank St√©phane Genaud,
director of the French Engineering School \textbf{ENSIIE}, who invested time to
create this link betweek the school and Cranfield University.

Of course I'm thankful to all the people I've met in Cranfield, with whom I've
shared my difficulties and my doubts and who reconforted me in the idea that I
wasn't as late as I thought in my work, or at least we were late altogether.
