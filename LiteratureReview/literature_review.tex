\section*{Introduction}

These 10 last years, the Internet has grown at an exponential rate. More and
more people are connected, and using always more numerous kinds of device.
As the demand is raising strongly, service providers have to be able to support
an increasingly amount of customers on their infrastructure. In 2006, Amazon
launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) is born, popularising the concept of cloud
computing. This platform allows developers and companies to allocate resources
on demand, and these are provisionned instantly.

The market of cloud computing has grown really quickly and forcasts predict that
this expansion won't stop in the near future.\cite{website:cloudcomputingmarket}
It is no coincidence if the industry and the academic environments are really
interested by this domain. On the one hand, it is a field where money is present
and on the second hand, we can consider that we are only at the beginning of an
era: a lot of things have to be developed, to be optimized and to be found.

\section{Background}

The evolution of the paradigm of cloud computing has been made possible thanks
to the virtualisation technology. As explained by Paul Barham et al.\cite{virtualisation},
it allows servers to be splitted in different parts, isolated from each other,
sharing the resources of the physical machine. Technologies have been developed to
give people much more flexibility in the way to manage their virtual machines also called
instances. Actually, the concept of live migration, which is detailled in the work
of Christopher Clark et al.\cite{livemigration}, has been built to move instances
from a physical host to another without interrupting the activity of what is running
inside a virtual machine. Using this mean,
